## Project Overview

This repository contains the static content for my portfolio website. I’ve used AWS S3 to host this static site, and it’s been a great way to deepen my understanding of cloud-based hosting solutions. The site showcases my work, skills, and projects, and serves as a hands-on application of my cloud and web development knowledge.

## Project Structure

Here’s a brief overview of the project's structure:

- **`css/`**: Directory containing CSS files for styling the website. I've organized the stylesheets here to keep everything neat.
- **`js/`**: Directory for JavaScript files that add interactivity to my site. Scripts for animations and user interactions are included here.
- **`images/`**: Folder containing image assets used throughout the website. This includes photos, icons, and other visual elements.
